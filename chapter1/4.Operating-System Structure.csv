multiprogram increases CPU utilization by | organizing jobs (code & data) so that the CPU always has something to execute
since main memory is too small to accommodate all jobs jobs are kept | on the disk in the job pool
the job pool consists of all porcesses | residing on the disk, awaiting allocation of main memory
the set of jobs in main memory is a subset of the jobs in | the job pool
when multiprogramming, the os picks and job to execute and then| executes until it has to wait for some task such as io to complete at which point it switches to another task
multiprogrammed systems give an environment in which system resources are | used effectively but do not provide user interaction
Time sharing means the cpu executes multiple jobs by | switching among them so quickly that it seems to a user like it's running multiple at the same time
time sharing requires what type of system | an interactive system.
a time-shared operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with | a small portion of time shared computer
a program loaded into memory and executing is called | a process.
when a process executes it only runs for | a short amount of time before it finishes or needs to do io.
if several jobs are ready to be brought into memor but there is not enough room for all of them the system must employ | job scheduling
in a time sharing system the os ensures reasonable response time which is accomplished through | swapping
swapping is the procedure where | processes are swapped in and out of main memory to disk
virtual memory is a technique that allows | the execution of a process not completely in memory
the advantage of virtual memory is that it allows users to run programs that are | larger than physical memory
virtual memory abstracts main memory into a | larg uniform array of storage
