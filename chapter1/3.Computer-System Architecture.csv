computer systems can be categorized by what |the number of general purpose precessors used
on a single processor system, there is one main CPU which can | execute a general purpose instruction set including instructions from user processes
most single processors also have other processors which are | special purpose, may come as device specific processors like keyboard or graphics controllers or more general io processors to move data rapidly
special purpose processors run | a limited instruction set and do not run user processes
special purpose processors can be managed by the operating system such that the operating system sends them | information about tehir next task and monitors their status
special purpose processors can be low level components built into hardware such that | they perform autaunomously and do not communicate with teh os
multiprocessors systems have | two or more processors in close communication
multiprocessor systems share what accross processors | the computer bus and the clock, memory, and peripheral devices
multiprocessor systems are better than singel processor systems because of what 3 things | 1. increased throughput2. economy of scale (share resources accross processors) 3. increased reliability (one breaks they don't all break)
for a system to be able to provide service proportional to the level of surviving hardware is called | graceful degradation
a system is fault tolerant if it can | suffer a failure of any singel component and continue operation
asymmetric multiprossessing means | each processor is assigned a task, a master processor controls the system while the others look to the master for tasks
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) means | each processor performs all tasks within an os, processors are peers
in an SMP architecture each processor has it's own | set of registers + private / local cache
in an SMP architecture each processor shares | physical memory
solaris is an a commercial version of unix which runs what architecture | symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
in a symmetric multiprocessing system (SMP) _ processes can run if there are _ cpus without a deterioration in performance | N, N
if one cpu is sitting idle while another is overloaded, it is probably a | SMP system
the difference between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing can result from either | hardware or software
multiprocessing can cause a system to change it's memory access mode from _ to _ | UMA to NUMA
UMA is the situation where | acces to any ram from the cpu takes the same amounto f time
NUMA is the situation where | some parts of memory take longer to access than other parts (performance penalty)
multiple cores on a single chip are | mure efficient than multiple chips with single cores due to on-chip communication and less power usage
multicore systems are good for | server systems (dbs and web servers)
multipcore cpus appear to the operating system as | N standard processors
blade servers are what | computer archetectures where multiple processor boards + io boards and networking boards are placed in the same chasis such that each board boots independently and runs it's own os
in essence blade servers ocnsiste of | multiple independendent multiprocessor systems
a clustered system is a system which |two or more individual systems / nodes are joined together
it is accepted that | clustered comptuers share storage and are linked closely via a LAN 
clustering will continue to provide service ever if one or more systems in the cluster fails meaning it is | high availability
Beowulf clusters are designed for | solving high performance comptuing tasks
beowulf clusters are built with | commodity hardware
beowulf clusters are connected over a | lan
high availablitiy is obtained by adding a layer of software on specific nodes to monitor other nodes and | take ownership of their storage and restart their applications if a machine fails
asymmetric clustering suggests that one machine is in | hot standby mode while the other is running the applications, if the runner fails the other picks up where the other left off
symmetric clustering suggests that two or more hosts are | running applications and monitoring each other.
clusters that provide high-performance computing environments are fast but must have specially written software that takes advantage of | parallelization, (dividing a program into separate components that run in parallel on individual computers in the cluster)
parallel clusters allow multiple hosts to | access the same data on shared storage\
a SAN allows | many systems to attach to a pool of storage
