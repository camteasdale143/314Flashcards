what does an operating system do | 1.it manages the computer hardware 2. provides a basis for application programs and 3. acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.
operating systems are designed to be what two adjectives? | convenient and efficient or somecombination of the two
a computer can be seperated into four components| hardware, operating system, application programs, and users
what are the important aspects of the hardware | the cpu, the memory, and io devices
what does the hardware do | provides the basic computing resources for the system
what do application programs do | difen ways in which these resources are usde to solve user's computing problems
how does operating system interact with teh hardware  and application programs | controls the hardware and coordinates it's use among the various application programs for users. provides the means for proper use of those resources in the operation of a computer system
why are operating systems like a governments | it performs no useful function by itself, it provides an environment where other programs can do useful work.
if a user sits in front of a pc with a monitor, keyboard, mouse and system unit, and is optimized for one user, the system is optimized for | ease of use as opposed to resource allocation
if the user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer, with other users accessing the same computer and the users share resources to exchanginformation what is the os optimized for | resources utilization, makes sure all cpu time, memory and io are used efficiently.
user sits at workstations connected to networks of other workstation servers, where each user has dedicated resources but also share resources | the os is made to comprimize between individual usability and resource utilization.
a mobile computer is optimized for | individual usability but also performance per unit of batery life.
from a systems view the os is seen as a | resource allocator
what resources does the computer system have available to it | cpu time, memory space, file-storage space, io
facing numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources, os's decide | how to allocate specific programs to users so it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.
an operating system is a control program, meaning it | manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. especially concerned with operation / control of io
what is the goal of a computer system | to execute user programs and make solving user promlems easier
program definition of an operating system | one program running at all times on the computer - usually called the kernel
system programs are | programs associated with eth operating system but are not the kernel
application programs are | programs not associated with teh operating system
