# 314 - Operating Systems notes

this repository contains all of the `.csv` files I am using to keep notes on Athabasc U course #314 - Operating Systems.

### How do I use this repository to study

I am using a software called anki in order to parse these `.csv` files into flashcards which I am practicing everyday. In order to use them you will have to ...
- clone this repo
- download anki
- create a Deck
- import cards into that deck from any of the files within this repo (make sure to change delimeter from `,` to `|`


_Happy Studying :sunglasses:_
